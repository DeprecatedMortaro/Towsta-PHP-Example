Understanding the Example
=========================

This example uses the framework Toy-PHP (<https://github.com/Mortaro/Toy-PHP>) and the lib Towsta-PHP (<https://github.com/Mortaro/Towsta-PHP>). To start a project like this, just clone the template of Toy-PHP, clone Towsta-PHP inside the folder "lib" and read the tips below.

About "modules" folder
----------------------

This is the modules folder generated by Towsta-PHP, here you can add your own functions inside each class, or simply leave it like that.

About "index.php"
-----------------

Here you synchronize with the Towsta's API and pass the fetched objects to a view. The URL "/books" will synchronize all the books from Towsta Manager's module, while "/books/123" will only synchronize the book with "123" as id.

About "views" folder
--------------------

Here is how you show the items from a Towsta's module in your website. The "views/layout.php" remains untouched since it's not important for this tutorial, the "views/books.php" is a `foreach()` over `all()` the synchronized objects displaying them as HTML, and the "views/book.php" shows the `first()` and only synchronized object as HTML.
